Learn to Love Lambdas in C# (and LINQ, Too!)
====================================

Abstract  
----------
Lambda expressions can be confusing the first time you walk up to them. But once you get to know them, you’ll see that they are a great addition to your toolbox. Used properly, they can add elegance and simplicity to your code. And some .NET constructs (such as LINQ) lend themselves to lambda expressions. We’ll take a look at how lambda expressions work and see them in action.

Projects
----------
* **PeopleViewer**  
WPF application with the main sample code
* **PeopleViewer.Library**  
The library that provides the core functionality for the application
* **PeopleViewer.MVVM**  
WPF application that uses the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern. This is how I would implement this particular applicaton (however, it does not show the use of lambda expressions quite as clearly as the "PeopleViewer" project).
